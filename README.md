#michele WINKELMAN  |  Designer & Front-End Web Developer

## whatIDo

I am a designer pursuing a new career as a developer and have recently completed a 3-month immersive JavaScript bootcamp. I am excited to leverage my 10+ years' experience in graphic design as I transition into front-end web development.   

## whyILoveIt

I have always been interested in computers and I love the blend of the technical and the creative. I have an intense willingness to learn and feel most inspired when working through difficult problems to build elegant, functional design solutions. I get excited to see people care about design for the web and I'm thrilled to be part of the tech industry as it continues to evolve and grow.

## howIGotHere

Although I earned a B.S. in apparel and textile design, I taught myself graphic design and worked in publishing and print for many years. Back then, I got my feet wet in web design and learned basic HTML and CSS while building my own self-promotional website. But recently I've fallen in love with the challenge of learning to code. I continue to grow my skills daily. I am on the lookout for new opportunities so please contact me at mlwinkelman@gmail.com.
