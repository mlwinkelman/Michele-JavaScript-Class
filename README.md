# Code Portfolio for mwinkelman

#### I am learning to code and currently finishing a 13-week JavaScript bootcamp. I love the blend of the technical with the creative and I am excited to leverage my 10+ years' experience in graphic design as I transition into front-end web development. I am on the lookout for new opportunities. Please hire me!
